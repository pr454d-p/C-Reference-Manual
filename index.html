          <p>C-- is a portable assembly language designed to be a good backend for high level languages (particularly
for those that make use of garbage-collection) and to run fast on a number of todays major
computer architectures. It is also designed to have as few dependencies as possible on the underlying
hardware, but speed and ease of use has sometimes taken precedence over orthogonality and
minimality. C-- should be rich enough to be a viable backend for most mainstream and research
compilers.</p>
<p>This paper should be sufficiently self-supporting so that anyone who knows an imperative language
and is acquainted with computers should be able to write her/his own C-- programs after reading this
document.</p>

    <p>The syntax of C-- is given in Figures 1 and 2.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        General</li>
        <p>A C-- program file is written in eight bit ASCII characters. It consists in a sequence of data layout
directives (Section 4), and/or procedure definitions (Section 5), and/or import declarations, and/or
export declarations (Section 2.5), interleaved in any order.</p>
<p>A C-- compilation unit is a C-- program file that can be successfully compiled and that is suitable
for linking.</p>
<p>C-- does not support input/output. Nevertheless, it can be accomplished using a foreign language
call (Section 3.8).</p>
<li>
  Comments</li>
  <p>Comments start with /* and end with */. They cannot be nested.</p>
  <li>
    Names</li>
    <p>Names are made up of letters, digits, underscore and dots. A name cannot begin with a number
character or with a dot followed by a number character. Upper and lower case are distinct. Imported
names should also follow these restrictions.</p>
<p>Names are identifiers for registers or memory addresses (Section 3.7).</p>
<p>The following are examples of legal C-- names:</p>
<code>
x<br>
foo<br>
_912<br>
aname12<br>
_foo.name_abit_12.long<br>
Sys.Indicators</code>
<p>These are two illegal C-- names:</p>
<code>
.9Aname<br>
3illegal</code>
<li>
  Name scope</li>
  <p>Procedure and label names are always global inside a C-- compilation unit (or program). Local variable
names and local control labels are only in scope of the procedure body where they are declared.
There is no nested scoping of names inside a procedure. Procedure and label names may be used
before they are declared.</p>
<li>
  The <i>import</i> and <i>export</i> declarations</li>
  <p>Names that are to be used outside of the C-- program must be exported with the export declaration.
Likewise, names that the C-- program uses and does not declare must be imported with the import
declaration. Only procedure and (pointer) label names may be exported.</p>
<p>Imported names should follow the syntatic restriction mentioned in Section 2.3.</p>
<p>An example where a few C external names are imported and a few C-- names are exported:</p>
<code>import printf, sqrt; /* C procedures used in this C-- program */<br>
export foo, bar; /* To be used outside this C-- program */</code>
<p>Names that are explicitly exported and imported are guaranteed to be unchanged by the compiler. All
other names might be renamed.</p>
<p>An import or an export declaration may appear anywhere in the program where a data layout
directive or a procedure definition does.</p>
<li>
  Constants</li>
  <p>Constants can be (signed) integers, (signed) floating point numbers, characters, strings and names.
C-- follows C’s syntax for denoting integer, floating point, character, and string constants.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Integer and floating point numbers</li>
    <p>Integer constants have of type word. Floating point constants have type float. Their size is
architecture-dependent.</p>
<li>
  Characters and strings</li>
  <p>Character and string constants are treated as integers and as pointer labels respectively. Character
constants are ASCII characters surrounded by single quotes. String constants are a sequence of ASCII
characters surrounded by double quotes.</p>
<p>A character constant is treated as an integer whose value is the character’s 8-bit ASCII code. Therefore,
character constants have type word1. C-- uses C’s escape sequences to denote special characters,
such as \n for the new line and \t for the tabulator.</p>
<p>For example, character constant ’H’ is a word1 with value 72.</p>
<p>String constants are like labels that point to the first word1 of an array of word1s stored in static
memory. Therefore, they have type wordn where n is the particular architecture’s natural pointer
size. String constants are not automatically null-terminated.</p>
<p>For example, the string "Hello World" is viewed as a label that points to the first byte of the array
of bytes with values 72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100, stored in static memory.</p>
<p>It is possible to have UTF-8 integers for single characters and for string characters.</p>
<p>The syntax to specify an UTF-8 constant is:</p>
<code>unicode(constant)</code>
<p>where constant is a character constant or a string constant. The type of UTF-8 characters is word2,
for it requires two bytes—two ASCII characters—to code a Unicode character. UTF-8 strings are
pointers to the first word2 of an array of word2s stored in static memory, and therefore, they have
type wordn, where n is the architecture’s natural pointer size.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Memory</li>
    <p>Memory is an array of bytes from which different sized types (Section 3.4) can be read and written.
The size of the addressable memory is implementation dependent (Section 3.6). All addresses and offsets are specified in bytes. No guarantee about endianess is given, i.e. a portable program should
either not depend on a specific endianess or find it out.</p>
<li>Data segment</li>
<p>The data segment is the part of memory where the static, initialised or uninitialised, data is allocated.
The data segment is read/write, so the values stored can be changed at runtime. The size and initial
content of the data segment is determined at compile time (Section 4). C-- does not provide dynamic
memory allocation natively, nonetheless, it can be accomplished with foreign language calls
(Section 3.8 and Section 5.3).</p>
<li>Code segment</li>
<p>The code segment is the part of memory where the executable program code is stored (Section 5).
The code segment consists of a series of procedure definitions.</p>
<p>C-- does not currently provide a mechanism for creating code at runtime.</p>
<li>Types</li>
<p>There are only two kinds of types provided by C--, namely word and float. These types can have
different sizes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The size of a word can be 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.</li>
  <li>The size of a float can be 4 or 8 bytes.</li>
</ul>
<p>A type must be qualified with a size. Thus word1 and word2 are different types.</p>
<p>There is no pointer type. The wordn type can be used for pointers (addresses), where n is the
particular architecture’s natural pointer size, i.e.: n is the number of bytes needed to hold a memory
address in the particular architecture.</p>
<p>For example, a four byte word is specified as word4, an eight byte float is specified as float8 and
so on.</p>
<p>Types are used in</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Declaration statements</b>(Section 5.2.2), to declare the type of local variables.</li>
  <li><b>Memory write statements and memory read expressions</b>(Section 5.2.4 and Section 6.2,
respectively) to indicate the type of the value written/read.</li>
<li><b>Data layout directives</b>(Section 4) to indicate the type of the allocated datum.</li>
</ol>
<li>Local variables (or registers)</li>
<p>Any number of local variable names may be declared inside procedure bodies. They are typed storage
locations that don’t have an address. The term “local variable name” is interchangeable with the term
“register”, since there is an unlimited supply of (virtual) registers: i.e. a local variable name will be mapped to a machine register if there is one available, otherwise it is mapped to a memory location
(e.g. the stack), but the mapping is transparent and local variables should be viewed as registers.</p>
<li>Addresses</li>
</p>To specify where in memory to read or write we need an address. Any expression that evaluates to
a wordn can be used as an address, where n is the architecture’s natural pointer size, i.e.: n is the
number of bytes needed to hold a memory address in the particular architecture.</p>
<p>Absolute addresses can be used but what they refer to is implementation dependent. Their type is also
wordn.</p>
<li>Names</li>
<p>A name declares either a register or amemory address. Register names are procedure’s local variables.
Memory address names are either labels (Section 4.1) or procedure names (Section 5).</p>
<li>Foreign language interface</li>
<p>The foreign language interface is a way for C-- programs to use other calling conventions for procedure
inter-operation with foreign code. This interface is nearly 100% portable across architectures
(Section 5.3).</p>

<section class="main-section" id="Data_layout_directives">
  <header>Data layout directives</header>
  <article>
    <p>Memory in the data segment is allocated using the data directive. A memory block is organised as
a sequence of typed data. Each datum is thought of as an array of bytes that may be initialised.</p>
<p>Here is an example that allocates and initializes some memory. In particular, it allocates 8 datums
of types word4, word2, float8, word4, word1, word2, word1 and word8 respectively. The
example is explained in more detail in the remainder of this section:</p>
<code>
  data {<br>
foo: word4[4]{1,2,3,ff}; /* ff is a forward reference */<br>
word2[4]{1,2};<br>
ff: float8[2]{2.8,3.1}; word4[2]{ff,foo};<br>
str: word1[]"Hello world\0";<br>
ustr: word2[]unicode("Hello world\0");<br>
word1;<br>
xs: word8[]{"This is an", "array of", "word8’s"};<br>
}<br>
</code>
<p>There may be any number of data layout directives in a C-- program.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Labels</li>
  <p>Labels are the means to refer to the allocated memory. They should be viewed as pointers and not as
memory locations. A label declaration consists of a name followed by a colon. Once declared, a label
is a name (and so an expression) that refers (points) to a memory address. Therefore it has wordn
type, where n is the particular architecture’s natural pointer size. Labels may be used before their
are declared, e.g. label ff is used in the initialisation of the data directive’s first datum before it is
declared pointing to the third.</p>
<i>Note that labels do not provide any information about the type of the data pointed to by them.</i>
<p>A label points to the first byte after its declaration. Here is an example in which four labels point to
the same datum:</p>
<code>data { foo: label1: label2: bar: word4} /* just allocates */</code>
<p>Memory is always allocated without padding inside a single data layout directive, so it is possible
to find any given data in the data segment by starting from a label and adding the right offset, as in,
for example, the read expression word2[foo+4]. Indeed, foo+4 does not have to point to the
beginning of a data element. It may point to any other data byte, but it is assumed by C-- that it is
2-byte aligned.</p>
<p>To align a label (and hence the datum it points to) to a specific boundary, an alignment directive
(Section 4.3) has to be placed before the label. In the following example, foo and bar might or
might not be the same address, but bar is guaranteed to be aligned on an eight byte boundary.</p>
<code>data { foo: align8;<br>
bar: word4{0};<br>
}</code>
<p>It is be possible to have a stupid data layout directive with no labels that is inaccessible.</p>
<li>Initialisation</li>
  <p>Memory is allocated by specifying the type of the datum, the number of datum’s elements to allocate,
and the initial value for each element. The particular syntax is:</p>
<code>type[n]{constant-list};</code>
<p>where n specifies how many elements of the type type have to be allocated, and constant-list provides
the initial value (of type type) for each allocated element, in the form of a comma-separated list
of constants or constant expressions (i.e. expressions whose value is known at compile time).</p>
<p>There are a number of possible variants:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If [n] is not provided, only one element is allocated. The {constant-list} may or may not be
provided. If provided, it should contain only one constant or constant expression to which the
element is initialised. If not provided, no initial value is given. For example:<br>
<code>
  data { lb1: word1; }<br>
/* Allocates one byte (contains garbage) */<br>
data { lb2: word1{17}; }<br>
/* Allocates one byte and initialises it to (ASCII code) 17 */<br>
data { lb3: word4{17}; }<br>
/* Allocates one 4-byte word and initialises it to integer 17 */<br>
</code>
</li>
<li>If [n] is provided, then n elements are allocated. The {constant-list} may or may not be
provided. If not provided, no initial value is given. If provided, it should contain c constants
or constant expressions, such that c  n. Element i (i : 0 : : : (n - 1)) is initialised to the
value of the constant or constant expression j (j : 0 : : : (c - 1)) in {constant-list}, such that
j = i mod c. For example:<br>
<code>
data { lb1: word1[17]; }<br>
/* Allocates 17 bytes (that contain garbage) */<br>
data { lb2: word1[17]{0}; }<br>
/* Allocates 17 bytes and initialises all of them to 0 */<br>
data { lb3: word4[6]{1,2,3}; }<br>
/* Allocates six 4-byte words and initialises them<br>
* to 1,2,3,1,2,3 respectively.<br>
*/<br>
data { lb4: word4[6]{1,2,3,1,2,3}; }<br>
/* Allocates six 4-byte words and initialises them<br>
* to 1,2,3,1,2,3 respectively.<br>
*/<br>
data { lb5: word4[4]{1,2,3}; }<br>
/* Allocates four 4-byte words and initialises them<br>
* to 1,2,3,1 respectively.<br>
*/<br>
</code>
</li>
<li>There is also the possibility to have abbreviations when n = c.<br>
<code>
type[]{constant-list}; is an abbreviation for type[c]{constant-list};
word1[]"char1 : : : charn"; is an abbreviation for word1[n]{’char1’, : : : ,’charn’};
word2[]unicode("char1 : : : charn"); is an abbreviation for
word2[n]{unicode(’char1’),. . .,unicode(’charn’)};</code>
<p>For example:</p>
<code>
data { s1: word1[6]{’h’,’e’,’l’,’l’,’o’,’\0’}; }
data { s2: word1[]"hello\0"; }
/* Both directives allocate 7 bytes and initialise
* them to the same ASCII code integers.
*/
data { f1: float8[3]{3.5, 4.4, 6.98}; }
data { f1: float8[] {3.5, 4.4, 6.98}; }
/* Both directives allocate three 8-byte floats and initialise
* them to the same floating point numbers.
*/
</code>
<p>Since the initialised value might have dependencies on the endianess, the only way to guarantee that
a memory read (Section 6.2) gets the same initialised (or written) value, is to read the datum or the
element with the same type as it was initialised (or written). For example, if a datum was initialised
with data {foo: word2{17};}, if read back with word1[foo] the value might be 0 or 17
depending on the architechture, but if read with word2[foo] it is guaranteed to be 17.</p></li>
</ol>
<li>Alignment</li>
<p>For performance reasons, and also to comply with some architecture requirements, it is sometimes
necessary to specify the alignment of data. The alignn directive inserts padding as needed, ensuring
that the next datum is placed on an n byte boundary. The value of the padding is unspecified.</p>
<p>In the following example, foo is aligned to a 4-byte boundary and bar to an 8-byte boundary. In both
cases padding may be inserted: for example, between the last byte of the word4 and the first byte of
the float8 (the datum pointed to by bar) there may be padding in order to place the float8 on
an 8-byte boundary.</p>
<code>
data { align4;<br>
foo: word4{1};<br>
align8;<br>
bar: float8{1.7};<br>
}<br>
</code>

<section class="main-section" id="Procedures">
  <header>Procedures</header>
  <article>
    <p>Procedures are the means to place information in the code segment. They are very similar to highlevel
language procedures. Procedures can optionally take arguments, contain static data declarations
and return values.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Procedure definition</li>
    <p>A procedure definition has the following syntax:</p>
    <code>conv proc name(type arg1,. . . ,type argn)<br>
{ body }
</code>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>conv</i> is the (optional) calling convention declaration (Section 5.3) needed for inter-operation.</li>
  <li><i>proc name</i> is the procedure name, which stands for the procedure entry point address and, as a
name, will be an expression (Section 3.7). It may be also used in call (Section 5.2.8) and jump
(Section 5.2.9) statements.</li>
<li><i>type arg1,. . . , type argn</i> is the formal argument list. Each formal argument consists of a
name preceded by its type. If the procedure takes no arguments, the list should be empty.
Unlike C, procedures with a variable number of arguments are not supported. The formal
arguments are only in scope of the procedure body.</li>
<li><i>body </i>is the procedure body enclosed in curly braces. It may consists of a sequence of statements,
such as local variable declarations, assignments, memory reads, local control label declarations,
gotos, etc. It is unspecified what happens if control flows off the edge of a procedure
body, that is, every control path in a procedure body should finish in a jump (Section 5.2.9) or
in a return (Section 5.2.10) statement. Therefore, a procedure body should have at least one
statement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The return type needs not be specified in the definition.</p>
<p>For example, procedure foo is defined as a procedure that expects one word4 argument. Inside the
procedure body, the local variable (or register) x is declared, followed by an assignment statement
and a jump statement to procedure bar.</p>
<code>
foo(word4 y) {<br>
word4 x;<br>
x = y + 1;<br>
jump bar(x);<br>
}<br>
</code>
<li>Statements</li>
<ol>
  <li><i>skip;</i></li>
  <p>This is just the null statement and can be inserted anywhere an ordinary statement can. It does not
have any effects. It is used for clarity instead of the error-prone stand-alone semicolon.</p>
<li>Declaration</li>
<p>A declaration statement has the following syntax:</p>
<code>type name1,. . . ,namen ;</code>
<p>It declares the local variable names name1 : : : namen of type type. These names will be mapped to
(virtual) machine registers. As names, they are also expressions of type type.</p>
<p>Local variables have to be declared before they are used.</p>
<p>Local variables have to be declared before they are used.</p>
<li>Assignment</li>
<p>An assignment statement has the following syntax:</p>
<code>name = expr ;</code>
<p>It stores the value of expr in the local variable (or register) name, where expr has the same type as
name.</p>
<li>Memory write</li>
<p>A memory write statement has the following syntax:</p>
<code>wordn[expr1] = expr2 ;</code>
<p>to write wordn values, or</p>
<code>floatn[expr1] = expr2 ;</code>
<p>to write floatn values.</p>
<p>Expression expr1 has type wordn, where n is the particular architecture’s natural pointer size, and its
value is the memory address in which the value of expr2 is written. Expression expr1 will typically
contain one or more labels. Expression expr2 should be of type wordn or floatn respectively,
otherwise the value written in memory is unspecified</p>
<p>The following example stores the ASCII integer code of ’A’ in the 4th byte of the datum pointed to
by label</p>
<code>word1[label+4] = ’A’;</code>
<p>The address yielded by expr1 is assumed aligned to the size of the type, namely, n. A memory write
can optionally be qualified with an alignment flag {aligna}, so the syntax is now:</p>
<code>wordn{aligna}[expr1] = expr2 ;
floatn{aligna}[expr1] = expr2 ;</code>
<p>A few examples of memory writes with flagged alignment:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>float8{align4}[label] = expr</i> does a 8-byte write but assumes that label is aligned
to a 4 byte boundary.</li>
<li><i>word4{align1}[label] = expr</i> does a 4-byte write but assumes that label is aligned
to a byte boundary (pointer to a byte).</li>
<li><i>word1{align4}[label] = expr</i> does a 1-byte write but assumes that label is aligned
to a 4 byte boundary.</li>
</ul>
<li><i>if</i> and relational operations</li>
<p>Conditional execution of code is accomplished with the if statement. It has the following syntax:</p>
<code>if expr1 rel expr2 { . . . } else { . . . }</code>
<p>The else branch is optional and the statement blocks may be empty, as in if x == 0 {}, but the
curly braces are mandatory even for single statements, as in</p>
<code>if x == 0 { x = x + 1;}</code>
<p>The condition test is very simple: it consists of a relational operation, rel, that takes two expressions
as arguments. The term “operation” is used instead of “operator”, therefore avoiding confusion with
C-- operators that are used in expressions (Section 6). Relational operations are only used in if
condition tests; they cannot be used anywhere else.</p>
<p>This is the set of relational operations:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Relation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>==</td>
    <td>Equality</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>!=</td>
    <td>NonEquality</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>></td>
    <td>Greater Than</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>>=</td>
    <td>Greater Than or Equal</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><</td>
    <td>Less Than</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><=</td>
    <td>Less Than or Equal</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  <p>They can all be combined with these flags:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Flag</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>Signed comparison (default)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>u</td>
      <td>Unsigned comparison(default)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>f</td>
      <td>Floating point comparison</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>fo</td>
      <td>Floating point unordered comparison; if supported</td>
    </tr>
 </table>   
 <p>When the condition test holds, the block of statements immediately following the condition test is
executed. Otherwise, if an optional else branch has been specified, its block of statements is executed.
After execution of the any of these blocks, control resumes at the first statement after the if
or if/else.</p>
<p>In the following example, >= is used in the if test condition without a flag (default signed comparison),
and != is used combined with flag u to test whether the unsigned integer held in x is zero.</p>
<code>
f(word4 x)<br>
{<br>
word4 y;<br>
y = 0;<br>
if y >= word4[foo+8] {<br>
y = y + 1;<br>
return (y);<br>
} else {<br>
x = x -u 1;<br>
if x !=u 0 {<br>
y = y + 2;<br>
}<br>
return (y);<br>
}<br>
}<br>
</code>

      <li>Introduction</li>
      <p>An C-- expression can be a constant, a name, a memory read, a primitive, or an operator applied
to other expressions. C-- makes a distinction between integer and floating point expressions, i.e.,
expressions that yield words or floats as result.</p>
<p>The integer and floating point model is based on the LIA-1 standard (ISO/IEC 10967-1:1994(E)) and
if there are any inconsistencies between this manual and LIA-1, the LIA-1 standard is correct, unless
otherwise noted.</p>
<p>Signed and unsigned numbers are not distinguished. Instead, like any other assembler, it is the operations
that are typed.</p>
<p>The type of any subexpression is always known and there are no automatic type casts or type conversions.</p>
<p>The following sections cover all the C-- operators, all the C-- primitives, and the memory read
expression.</p>
<li>memory read</li>
<p>Memory read expressions have the following syntax:</p>
<code>wordm[expr]<br>
Type: wordn !word</code>
<p>to read a wordm value, and</p>
<code>floatm[expr]<br>
Type: wordn !floatm</code>
<p>to read a floatm value.</p>
<p>Expression expr has type wordn, where n is the particular architecture’s natural pointer size. Its
value is the address of the memory location to read from. It will typically contain one or more labels.
The size m indicates how many bytes to read from that location.</p>
<p>The following example expression reads a 4-byte word from the second byte pointed to by label p:</p>
<code>word4[p+1]</code>
<p>The address yielded by expr is assumed aligned to an m-byte boundary. A memory read can optionally
be qualified with an alignment flag {aligna}. The syntax is:</p>
<code>wordm{aligna}[expr]
floatm{aligna}[expr]</code>
<p>A few examples of memory reads with flagged alignment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>float8{align4}[label] reads a 8-byte float but assumes that label is aligned to a
4 byte boundary.</li>
<li>word4{align1}[label] reads a 4-byte word but assumes that label is aligned to a
byte boundary (pointer to a byte).</li>
<li>word1{align4}[label] reads 1-byte but assumes that label is aligned to a 4 byte
boundary.</li>
</ul>

    <p>This is the TO DO list. It lists all the open issues and the stuff that remains to be added to this manual.

<h3>Expressions and constants</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Type conversion (not casting, but conversion):
float!word<br>
word !float<br>
</li>
<li>Casting float!word.</li>
<li>Add w/ carry operator missing.</li>
<li>How to define symbolic name constants.</li>
<li>Be more specific about number constants and their syntax. Saying that they’re like C’s is not enough.</li>
<li>Regarding pointers.</li>
<p>Pointer arithmetic, e.g.: float4[ptr + i] = float4[ptr];</p>
<p>If natural pointer size is 8 then ptr has type word8; adding integer offset register i (say, of type word4), if numbers
have word4 type then expression ptr+i needs a explicit casting: ptr + word8(i). More architecturedependancy
in the code. (See “Preprocessing”)</p>
<p>Also, C-- has only one pointer type wordn, where n is the architecture’s natural pointer size. Could that cause
troubles for architectures that offer two or more pointer sizes? Maybe not because we could just get the bigger (less
restrictive) size, but I am not sure if that makes sense.</p>
<li>Easy to tell expression type.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preprocessing</h3>
<p>C’s preprocessing directives can be used in C-- (it would be easy to do, the C-- compiler just passes the C preprocessor to
the C-- program before compiling it). It would help for offset-calculation expressions in architectures where the type of an
integer is say word4 and the type of a label is word8, and lots of typecast have to be done (since casting is not automatically
done), for offsets, in expressions like</p>
<code>word4[label+ word8(3)] = 43;</code>
<p>where the integer is typecast, we could have:</p>
<code>
#ifdef ... /* pointer size == integer size == 8*/<br>
#then<br>
#define CAST(x) (x)<br>
#else /* pointer size != integer size == 4 */<br>
#define CAST(x) word8((x))<br>
word4[label+CAST(3)] = 43;</code>
<p>to avoid to modify the C-- code anytime we want to port the code. For more complicated expressions rewriting will be
tedious.</p>
<p>Talk about preprocessing in the manual.</p>
<h3>Data layout directives</h3>
<p>Allow expressions in data declarations to specify the number of elements. These expressions should have values known at
compile-time. That is, instead of type[sconst]... , it should be: type[expr]... in Figure 1.</p>
<h3>Procedures and statements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Local declarations. Why the block as an statement?
The manual says that no nested scoping is possible in NESTED SCOPING section.</li>
<li>Stack directive.</li>
<li>Which calling conventions are there? Now: C, Pascal.</li>
<li>Have optional list in return, e.g., instead of return ();, just return;?</li>
<li>switch: could it take also expressions as alternatives? Right now each alternative must be a list of constants, but
the former is not difficult to implement, although it is inefficient.<li>
  <p>Explain better how the optional range improves compiler performance in the switch statement.</p>
  <li>Static data in procedures: global or local scope? Indicate in manual.</li>
  <p>Static data declarations in procedures. The following has been removed from Section 5:</p>
  <p>When declaring static data in a procedure, the data has to be declared between the name plus formal argument list,
and the procedure body. In memory, the data will be placed immediately before the procedure’s entry point, so that
the procedure name points to the memory after the data. In the following example, word4[foo - 4] has the
value 4711.</p>
<code>
foo()<br>
data { word4{31415, 4711}; }<br>
{<br>
word4 x;<br>
x = x + 1;<br>
return(x);<br>
}<br>
</code>
